Abstract

   Status Attestation is a signed object that demonstrates the validity
   status of a digital credential.  These attestations are periodically
   provided to holders, who can present these to Verifiers along with
   the corresponding digital credentials.  The approach outlined in this
   document makes the verifiers able to check the non-revocation of a
   digital credential without requiring to query any third-party
   entities.

1.  Introduction

   Status Attestations ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of
   digital credentials, whether in JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or CBOR Web
   Tokens (CWT) format, certifying their validity and non-revocation
   status.  They function similarly to OCSP Stapling, allowing wallet
   instances to present time-stamped attestations from the Credential
   Issuer.  The approach defined in this specification allows the
   verification of credentials against any revocation, without direct
   queries to the issuer, enhancing privacy, reducing latency, and
   enabling offline verification.  Essential for offline scenarios,
   Status Attestations validate digital credentials' validity, balancing
   scalability, security, and privacy without internet connectivity.

   The Status Attestation is presented along with its digital
   credential, to prove the non-revocation status of a digital
   credential to a Verifier.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "End-User", "Entity" as defined by
   OpenID Connect Core [@OpenID.Core], the term "JSON Web Token (JWT)"
   defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519].

   Digital Credential:  A set of one or more claims about a subject made
      by a Credential Issuer.

   Credential Issuer:  Entity that is responsible for the issuance of
      the Digital Credentials.  The Issuer is responsible for the
      lifecycle of their issued Digital Credentials and their validity
      status.

   Verifier:  Entity that relies on the validity of the Digital
      Credentials presented to it.  This Entity, also known as a Relying
      Party, verifies the authenticity and validity of the Digital
      Credentials, including their revocation status, before accepting
      them.

   Wallet Instance:  The digital Wallet in control of a User, also known
      as Wallet or Holder.  It securely stores the User's Digital
      Credentials.  It can present Digital Credentials to Verifiers and
      request Status Attestations from Issuers under the control of the
      User.

4.  Rationale

   OAuth Status Lists [@!I-D.looker-oauth-jwt-cwt-status-list] are
   suitable for specific scenarios, especially when the Verifier needs
   to verify the status of a Digital Credential at a later time after
   the User has presented the Digital Credential.

   However, there are cases where the Verifier only needs to check the
   revocation status of a Digital Credential at the time of
   presentation, or situations where the Verifier should not be allowed
   to check the status of a Digital Credential over time due to some
   privacy constraints, in compliance with national privacy regulations.

   For instance, consider a scenario under the European Union's General
   Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), where a Verifier's repeated access
   to a Status List to check the revocation status of a Digital
   Credential could be deemed as excessive monitoring of the End-User's
   activities.  This could potentially infringe upon the End-User's
   right to privacy, as outlined in Article 8 of the European Convention
   on Human Rights, by creating a detailed profile of the End-User's
   interactions and credential usage without explicit consent for such
   continuous surveillance.

   In scenarios where the Verifier, Credential Issuer, and OAuth Status
   List Provider are all part of the same domain or operate within a
   context where a high level of trust exists between them and the End-
   User, the OAuth Status List is the optimal solution; while there
   might be other cases where the OAuth Status List facilitates the
   exposure to the following privacy risks:

   *  An OAuth Status List Provider might know the association between a
      specific list and a Credential Issuer, especially if the latter
      issues a single type of Digital Credential.  This could
      inadvertently reveal the Status List Provider which list
      corresponds to which Digital Credential.

   *  A Verifier retrieves an OAuth Status List by establishing a TCP/IP
      connection with an OAuth Status List Provider.  This allows the
      OAuth Status List Provider to obtain the IP address of the
      Verifier and potentially link it to a specific Digital Credential
      type and Credential Issuer associated with that OAuth Status List.
      A malicious OAuth Status List Provider could use internet
      diagnostic tools, such as Whois or GeoIP lookup, to gather
      additional information about the Verifier.  This could
      inadvertently disclose to the OAuth Status List Provider which
      Digital Credential the requester is using and from which
      Credential Issuer, information that should remain confidential.

   Status Attestations differ significantly from OAuth Status Lists in
   several ways:

   1.  *Privacy*: Status Attestations are designed to be privacy-
       preserving.  They do not require the Verifier to gather any
       additional information from third-party entities, thus preventing
       potential privacy leaks.

   2.  *Static Verification*: Status Attestations are designed to be
       statically provided to Verifiers by Wallet Instance.  Once a
       Status Attestation is issued, it can be verified without any
       further communication with the Credential Issuer or any other
       party.

   3.  *Digital Credentials Formats*: Status Attestations are agnostic
       from the Digital Credential format to which they are bound.

   4.  *Trust Model*: Status Attestations operate under a model where
       the Verifier trusts the Credential Issuer to provide accurate
       status information, while the OAuth Status Lists operate under a
       model where the Verifier trusts the Status List Provider to
       maintain an accurate and up-to-date list of statuses.

   5.  *Offline flow*: OAuth Status List can be accessed by a Verifier
       when an internet connection is present.  At the same time, OAuth
       Status List defines how to provide a static Status List Token, to
       be included within a Digital Credential.  This requires the
       Wallet Instance to acquire a new Digital Credential for a
       specific presentation.  Even if similar to the OAuth Status List
       Token, the Status Attestations enable the User to persistently
       use their preexistent Digital Credentials, as long as the linked
       Status Attestation is available and presented to the Verifier,
       and not expired.

5.  Requirements

   The general requirements for the implementation of Status Attestation
   are listed in this section.  The Status Attestation:

   *  MUST be presented in conjunction with the Digital Credential.  The
      Status Attestation MUST be timestamped with its issuance datetime,
      always referring to a previous period to the presentation time.

   *  MUST contain the expiration datetime after which the Digital
      Credential MUST NOT be considered valid anymore.  The expiration
      datetime MUST be superior to the issuance datetime.

   *  enables offline use cases as it MUST be validated using a
      cryptographic signature and the cryptographic public key of the
      Credential Issuer.

   Please note: in this specification the examples and the normative
   properties of Attestations are reported in accordance with the JWT
   standard, while for the purposes of this specification any Digital
   Credential or Attestation format may be used, as long as all
   attributes and requirements defined in this specification are
   satisfied, even using equivalent names or values.

6.  Proof of Possession of a Credential

   The concept of Proof of Possession (PoP) of a Credential within the
   framework of the Status Attestation specification encompasses a
   broader perspective than merely possessing the digital bytes of the
   Credential.  It involves demonstrating rightful control or ownership
   over the Credential, which can manifest in various forms depending on
   the technology employed and the nature of the digital Credential
   itself.  For instance, a Credential could be presented visually (de-
   visu) with a personal portrait serving as a binding element.

   While this specification does not prescribe any additional methods
   for the proof of possession of the Credential, it aims to offer
   guidance for concrete implementations utilizing common proof of
   possession mechanisms.  This includes, but is not limited to:

   1.  Having the digital representation of the credential (the bytes).

   2.  Controlling a private key that corresponds to a public key
       associated with the Credential, often indicated within the
       Credential's cnf (confirmation) claim or through a similar
       mechanism.

   The essence of requiring control over the private key and its
   demonstration through a cryptographic operation (e.g., signing a
   challenge or a token) is to ensure that the entity in possession of
   the Credential can execute actions exclusively reserved for the
   legitimate subject.  The dual-layered approach of requiring both
   possession of the Credential and control over the corresponding
   private key indeed reinforces the security and integrity of the
   status attestation process.  It also ensures that the entity
   requesting a Status Attestation is indeed the same entity to which
   the Credential was originally issued, affirming the authenticity and
   rightful possession of the Credential.

7.  Status Attestation Request

   The Credential Issuer provides the Wallet Instance with a Status
   Attestation, which is bound to a Digital Credential.  This allows the
   Wallet Instance to present it, along with the Digital Credential
   itself, to a Verifier as proof of the Digital Credential's non-
   revocation status.

   The following diagram shows the Wallet Instance requesting a Status
   Attestation to a Credential Issuer, related to a specific Credential
   issued by the same Credential Issuer.

   +-------------------+                         +--------------------+

   The Wallet Instance sends the Status Attestation request to the
   Credential Issuer.  The request MUST contain the base64url hash value
   of the Digital Credential, for which the Status Attestation is
   requested, and enveloped in a signed object as proof of possession.
   The proof of possession MUST be signed with the private key
   corresponding to the public key attested by the Credential Issuer and
   contained within the Digital Credential.

   POST /status HTTP/1.1
   Host: issuer.example.org
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   credential_pop=$CredentialPoPJWT

   To validate that the Wallet Instance is entitled to request its
   Status Attestation, the following requirements MUST be satisfied:

   *  The Credential Issuer MUST verify the signature of the
      credential_pop object using the public key contained in the
      Digital Credential;

   *  the Credential Issuer MUST verify that it is the legitimate
      Issuer.

   The technical and details about the credential_pop object are defined
   in the next section.

7.1.  Status Attestation Request Errors

   In cases where a Status Attestation request is made for a Digital
   Credential that does not exist, has expired, been revoked, or is in
   any way invalid, or if the HTTP Request is compromised by missing or
   incorrect parameters, the Credential Issuer is required to respond
   with an HTTP Response.  This response should have a status code of
   400 and use application/json as the content type, including the
   following parameters:

   *  error, REQUIRED.  The value must be assigned one of the error
      types as specified in the OAuth 2.0 RFC Section 5.2
      (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.2);

   *  error_description, OPTIONAL.  Text in human-readable form that
      offers more details to clarify the nature of the error encountered
      (for instance, changes in some attributes, reasons for revocation,
      other).

   Below a non-normative example of an HTTP Response with an error.

  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

  {
    "error":"invalid_request"
    "error_description": "The signature of credential_pop JWT is not valid"
  }

7.2.  Digital Credential Proof of Possession

   The Wallet Instance that holds a Digital Credential, when requests a
   Status Attestation, MUST demonstrate the proof of possession of the
   Digital Credential to the Credential Issuer.

   The proof of possession is made by enclosing the Digital Credential
   in an object (JWT) signed with the private key that its related
   public key is referenced in the Digital Credential.

   Below is a non-normative example of a Credential proof of possession
   with the JWT headers and payload are represented without applying
   signature and encoding, for better readability:

   {
       "alg": "ES256",
       "typ": "status-attestation-request+jwt",
       "kid": $CREDENTIAL-CNF-JWKID
   }
   .
   {
       "iss": "0b434530-e151-4c40-98b7-74c75a5ef760",
       "aud": "https://issuer.example.org/status-attestation-endpoint",
       "iat": 1698744039,
       "exp": 1698834139,
       "jti": "6f204f7e-e453-4dfd-814e-9d155319408c",
       "credential_hash": $Issuer-Signed-JWT-Hash
       "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
   }

   When the JWT format is used, the JWT MUST contain the parameters
   defined in the following table.

8.  Status Attestation

   When a Status Attestation is requested to a Credential Issuer, the
   Issuer checks the status of the Digital Credential and creates a
   Status Attestation bound to it.

   If the Digital Credential is valid, the Credential Issuer creates a
   new Status Attestation, which a non-normative example is given below.

   {
       "alg": "ES256",
       "typ": "status-attestation+jwt",
       "kid": $ISSUER-JWKID
   }
   .

       "iss": "https://issuer.example.org",
       "iat": 1504699136,

       "credential_hash": $CREDENTIAL-HASH,

       "cnf": {
           "jwk": {...}
       }
   }

9.  Status Attestation Response

   If the Status Attestation is requested for a non-existent, expired,
   revoked or invalid Digital Credential, the Credential Issuer MUST
   respond with an HTTP Response with the status code set to 404.

   If the Digital Credential is valid, the Credential Issuer MUST return
   an HTTP status code of 201 (Created), with the content type set to
   application/json.  The response MUST include a JSON object with a
   member named status_attestation, which contains the Status
   Attestation for the Wallet Instance, as illustrated in the following
   non-normative example:

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "status_attestation": "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1Ni ...",
   }

10.  Credential Issuers Supporting Status Attestations

   This section outlines how Credential Issuers support Status
   Attestations, detailing the necessary metadata and practices to
   integrate into their systems.

10.1.  Credential Issuer Metadata

   The Credential Issuers that uses the Status Attestations MUST include
   in their OpenID4VCI [@!OpenID.VCI] metadata the claims:

   *  status_attestation_endpoint.  REQUIRED.  It MUST be an HTTPs URL
      indicating the endpoint where the Wallet Instances can request
      Status Attestations.

   *  credential_hash_alg_supported.  REQUIRED.  The supported Algorithm
      used by the Wallet Instance to hash the Digital Credential for
      which the Status Attestation is requested, using one of the hash
      algorithms listed in the IANA - Named Information Hash Algorithm
      Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/
      named-information.xhtml#hash-alg).

10.2.  Issued Digital Credentials

   The Credential Issuers that uses the Status Attestations SHOULD
   include in the issued Digital Credentials the object status with the
   JSON member status_attestation set to a JSON Object containing the
   following member:

   *  credential_hash_alg.  REQUIRED.  The Algorithm used of hashing the
      Digital Credential to which the Status Attestation is bound, using
      one of the hash algorithms listed in the IANA - Named Information
      Hash Algorithm Registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-
      information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg).  Among the hash
      algorithms, sha-256 is recommended and SHOULD be implemented by
      all systems.

   The non-normative example of an unsecured payload of an SD-JWT VC is
   shown below.

   {
    "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential",
    "given_name": "John",
    "family_name": "Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
    "address": {
      "street_address": "123 Main St",
      "locality": "Anytown",
      "region": "Anystate",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
    "is_over_18": true,
    "is_over_21": true,
    "is_over_65": true,
    "status": {
       "status_attestation": {
           "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
       }
    }
   }

10.2.1.  Credential Issuer Implementation Considerations

   When the Digital Credential is issued, the Credential Issuer SHOULD
   calculate the hash value using the algorithm specified in
   status.status_attestation.credential_hash_alg and store this
   information in its database.  This practice enhances efficiency by
   allowing the Credential Issuer to quickly compare the requested
   `credential_hash with the pre-calculated one, when processing Status
   Attestation requests made by Holders.

11.  Presenting Status Attestations

   The Wallet Instance that provides the Status Attestations using
   [@OpenID4VP], SHOULD include in the vp_token JSON array, as defined
   in [@OpenID4VP], the Status Attestation along with the related
   Digital Credential.

   The Verifier that receives a Digital Credential supporting the Status
   Attestation, SHOULD:

   *  Decode and validate the Digital Credential;

   *  check the presence of status.status_attestation in the Digital
      Credential.  If true, the Verifier SHOULD:

      -  produce the hash of the Digital Credential using the hashing
         algorithm configured in
         status.status_attestation.credential_hash_alg;

      -  decode all the Status Attestations provided in the
         presentation, by matching the JWS Header parameter typ set to
         status-attestation+jwt and looking for the credential_hash
         value that matches with the hash produced at the previous
         point;

      -  evaluate the validity of the Status Attestation.

   Please note: The importance of checking the revocation status of
   Digital Credentials as a 'SHOULD' rather than a 'MUST' for a Verifier
   who gets Status Attestation for the Digital Credential stems from the
   fact that the decision of a Verifier to check the revocation status
   of Digital Credentials is not absolute and can be influenced by
   numerous variables.  Consider as an example the case of age-over x;
   even if it has expired, it may still perform its intended purpose.
   As a result, the expiration status alone does not render it invalid.
   The adaptability recognizes that the need to verify revocation status
   may not always coincide with the actual usability of a Digital
   Credential, allowing Verifiers to examine and make educated
   conclusions based on a variety of scenarios.

12.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

13.  Privacy Considerations

   In the design and implementation of Status Attestations, particular
   attention has been paid to privacy considerations to ensure that the
   system is respectful of user privacy and compliant with relevant
   regulations.

13.1.  Privacy Consideration: Status Attestation Request Opacity

   The request for a status attestation does not transmit the digital
   credential for which the status is being attested.  Instead, it
   includes a proof of possession (PoP) of the credential that is only
   interpretable by the credential issuer who issued the digital
   credential for which the status attestation is requested.  This PoP
   can be achieved through a cryptographic signature using the public
   key contained within the digital credential over the request.  This
   method is essential for preventing the potential for fraudulent
   requests intended to mislead or disclose sensitive information to
   unintended parties.  By separating the digital credential from the
   status attestation request, the system ensures that the request does
   not inadvertently disclose any information about the digital
   credential or its holder.  This strategy significantly enhances the
   privacy and security of the system by preventing the attestation
   process from being used to collect information about digital
   credentials or their holders through deceptive requests.

13.2.  Privacy Consideration: Opacity of Status Attestation Content

   An important privacy consideration is how the status attestation is
   structured to ensure it does not reveal any information about the
   user or the holder of the digital credential.  The status attestation
   is crafted to prove only the vital information needed to verify the
   current state of a digital credential, moving beyond simple
   revocation or suspension checks.  This is done by focusing the
   attestation content on the credential's present condition and the
   method for its verification, rather than on the identity of the
   credential's holder.  This approach is key in keeping the user's
   anonymity intact, making sure that the status attestation can be
   applied in various verification situations without risking the
   privacy of the people involved.

13.3.  Unlinkability and Reusability of Status Attestations

   Status Attestations are designed to uphold privacy by allowing
   verifiers to operate independently, without the need for interaction
   or information disclosure to third-party entities or other verifiers.
   This design is pivotal in ensuring unlinkability between verifiers,
   where actions taken by one verifier cannot be correlated or linked to
   actions taken by another.  Verifiers can directly validate the status
   of a digital credential through the Status Attestation, eliminating
   the need for external communication.  This mechanism is key in
   protecting the privacy of individuals whose credentials are being
   verified, as it significantly reduces the risk of tracking or
   profiling based on verification activities across various services.

   While Status Attestations facilitate unlinkability, they are not
   inherently "single use."  The specification accommodates the batch
   issuance of multiple status attestations, which can be single-use.
   However, particularly for offline interactions, a single attestation
   may be utilized by numerous verifiers.  This flexibility ensures that
   Status Attestations can support a wide range of verification
   scenarios, from one-time validations to repeated checks by different
   entities, without compromising the privacy or security of the
   credential holder.

13.4.  Untrackability by Digital Credential Issuers and the "Phone Home"
       Problem

   A fundamental aspect of the privacy-preserving attributes of Status
   Attestations is their ability to address the "phone home" problem,
   which is the prevention of tracking by digital credential issuers.
   Traditional models often require verifiers to query a central status
   list or contact the issuer directly, a process that can inadvertently
   allow issuers to track when and where a digital credential is
   verified.  Status Attestations, however, encapsulate all necessary
   verification information within the attestation itself.  This design
   choice ensures that credential issuers are unable to monitor the
   verification activities of their issued digital credentials, thereby
   significantly enhancing the privacy of the credential holder.  By
   removing the need for real-time communication with the issuer for
   status checks, Status Attestations effectively prevent the issuer
   from tracking verification activities, further reinforcing the
   system's dedication to protecting user privacy.

13.5.  Minimization of Data Exposure

   The Status Attestations are designed around the data minimization
   principle.  Data minimization ensures that only the necessary
   information required for the scope of attesting the non revocation
   status of the digital credential.  This minimizes the exposure of
   potentially sensitive data.

13.6.  Resistance to Enumeration Attacks

   The design of Status Attestations incorporates measures to resist
   enumeration attacks, where an adversary attempts to gather
   information by systematically verifying different combinations of
   data.  By implementing robust cryptographic techniques and limiting
   the information contained in status attestations, the system reduces
   the feasibility of such attacks.  This consideration is vital for
   safeguarding the privacy of the credential holders and for ensuring
   the integrity of the verification process.

   Status Attestations are based on a privacy-by-design approach,
   reflecting a deliberate effort to balance security and privacy needs
   in the Digital Credential ecosystem.
