             draft-demarco-oauth-status-attestations-latest

Abstract

   Status Assertion is a signed object that demonstrates the validity
   status of a digital credential.  These assertions are periodically
   provided to holders, who can present these to verifier along with the
   corresponding digital credentials.  The approach outlined in this
   document makes the verifier able to check the non-revocation of a
   digital credential without requiring to query any third-party
   entities.

1.  Introduction

   Status Assertions ensure the non-revocation of digital credentials,
   whether in JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) format.
   Status Assertions function similarly to OCSP Stapling, allowing
   clients to present to the relying parties time-stamped assertions
   provided by the credential issuer.  The approach outlined in this
   specification enables the verification of credentials against
   revocation without direct queries to third-party systems, enhancing
   privacy, reducing latency, and faciliting offline verification.

   The figure below illustrates the process by which a client, such as a
   Wallet Instance, requests and obtains a Status Assertion from the
   credential issuer.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "End-User", "Entity" as defined by
   OpenID Connect Core [@OpenID.Core], the term "JSON Web Token (JWT)"
   defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519], the term "CBOR Web Token
   (CWT)" defined in [RFC8392], "Client" as defined [RFC6749]

   Holder:  An entity that receives Verifiable Credentials and has
      control over them to present them to the Verifiers as Verifiable
      Presentations.

   Digital Credential:  A set of one or more claims about a subject made
      by a Credential Issuer.  Alternative names are "Verifiable
      Credential" or "Credential".

   Credential Issuer:  Entity that is responsible for the issuance of
      the Digital Credentials.  The Issuer is responsible for the
      lifecycle of their issued Digital Credentials and their validity
      status.

   Holder:  An entity that receives Verifiable Credentials and has
      control over them to present them to the Verifiers as Verifiable
      Presentations.

   Verifier:  Entity that relies on the validity of the Digital
      Credentials presented to it.  This Entity, also known as a Relying
      Party, verifies the authenticity and validity of the Digital
      Credentials, including their revocation status, before accepting
      them.

   Wallet Instance:  The digital Wallet in control of a User, also known
      as Wallet.  It securely stores the User's Digital Credentials.  It
      can present Digital Credentials to Verifiers and request Status
      Assertions from Issuers under the control of the User.  For the
      purposes of this specification, the Wallet Instance is considered
      as a Client.

4.  Rationale

   There are cases where the Verifier only needs to check the revocation
   status of a Digital Credential at the time of presentation, and
   therefore it should not be allowed to check the status of a Digital
   Credential over time due to some privacy constraints, in compliance
   with national privacy regulations.

   For instance, consider a scenario where a Verifier's repeated access
   to a status list, such as the one defined in draft-ietf-oauth-status-
   list (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-status-list/)
   to check the revocation status of a Digital Credential could be
   deemed as excessive monitoring of the End-User's activities.

   This could potentially infringe upon the End-User's right to privacy,
   as outlined in [Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]
   (https://www.echr.coe.int/documents/convention_eng.pdf) and in the
   the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR
   (https://gdpr-info.eu/)), by creating a detailed profile of the End-
   User's Digital Credential status without explicit consent for such
   continuous surveillance.

5.  Requirements

   The general requirements for the implementation of Status Assertion
   are listed in this section.  The Status Assertion:

   *  SHOULD be presented in conjunction with the Digital Credential.
      The Status Assertion MUST be timestamped with its issuance
      datetime, using a timestamp which is later then the time of
      presentation issuance;

   *  MUST contain the expiration datetime after which the Digital
      Credential MUST NOT be considered valid anymore.  The expiration
      datetime MUST be superior to the Status Assertion issuance
      datetime and it MUST end before the expiration of the Credential;

   *  MUST enable the offline use cases by employing validation using a
      cryptographic signature and the cryptographic public key of the
      Credential Issuer.

   *  MUST include information that links it to the referenced Digital
      Credential;

   *  MUST NOT contain personal information about the User who owns the
      Digital Credential to which the Status Assertion refers.

6.  Proof of Possession of a Credential

   The concept of Proof of Possession (PoP) of a Credential within the
   framework of the Status Assertion specification encompasses a broader
   perspective than merely possessing the digital bytes of the
   Credential.  It involves demonstrating rightful control or ownership
   over the Credential, which can manifest in various forms depending on
   the technology employed and the nature of the Digital Credential
   itself.  For instance, a Digital Credential could be presented
   visually (de-visu) with a personal portrait serving as a binding
   element.

   While this specification does not prescribe any additional methods
   for the proof of possession of the Credential, it aims to offer
   guidance for concrete implementations utilizing common proof of
   possession mechanisms.  This includes, but is not limited to:

   1.  Having the digital representation of the Digital Credential (the
       bytes).

   2.  Controlling the confirmation method of the Credential, using the
       Credential's cnf parameter.

   The essence of requiring proof of possession over the Credential
   through the confirmation method, such has proving the control of the
   cryptographic material related to a Credential, is to ensure that the
   entity in possession of the Credential can execute actions
   exclusively reserved to the legitimate Holder.  The dual-layered
   approach of requiring both possession of the Credential and control
   over it, reinforces the security and integrity of the Status
   Assertion process.  This ensures that the Holder requesting a Status
   Assertion is indeed the same Holder to which the Credential was
   originally issued, affirming the authenticity and rightful possession
   of the Credential.

7.  Status Assertion Request

   The Credential Issuer provides the Wallet Instance with a Status
   Assertion, which is bound to a Digital Credential.  This allows the
   Wallet Instance to present it, along with the Digital Credential
   itself, to a Verifier as proof of the Digital Credential's non-
   revocation status.

   The following diagram shows the Wallet Instance requesting a Status
   Assertion to a Credential Issuer, related to a specific Credential
   issued by the same Credential Issuer.

   The Wallet Instance sends the Status Assertion request to the
   Credential Issuer, where: - The request MUST contain the base64url
   encoded hash value of the Digital Credential, for which the Status
   Assertion is requested, and enveloped in a signed Status Assertion
   Request object. - The Status Assertion Request object MUST be signed
   with the private key corresponding to the confirmation claim assigned
   by the Issuer and contained within the Digital Credential.

   When the JWT or CWT format are used, the JWT/CWT MUST contain the

   Below a non-normative example representing a Status Assertion Request
   array with a single Status Assertion Reuqest object in JWT format.

POST /status HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.example.org
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "status_assertion_requests" : ["${base64url(json({typ: (some pop for status-assertion)+jwt, ...}))}.payload.signature", ... ]
}

   The Status Assertion HTTP request can be sent to a single Credential
   Issuer regarding multiple Digital Credentials, and MUST contain a
   JSON object with the member status_assertion_requests.

   The status_assertion_requests MUST be set with an array of strings,
   where each string within the array represents a Digital Credential
   Status Assertion Request object.

   The Credential Issuer that receives the Status Assertion Request
   object MUST validate that the Wallet Instance making the request is
   authorized to request Status Assertions.  Therefore the following
   requirements MUST be satisfied:

   *  The Credential Issuer MUST verify the compliance of all elements
      in the status_assertion_requests object using the confirmation
      method contained within the Digital Credential where the Status
      Assertion Request object is referred to;

   *  The Credential Issuer MUST verify that it is the legitimate Issuer
      of the Digital Credential to which each Status Assertion Request
      object refers.

8.  Status Assertion Response

   The response MUST include a JSON object with a member named
   status_assertion_responses, which contains the Status Assertions and
   or the Status Assertion Errors related to the request made by the
   Wallet Instance.  In the non-normative example below is represented
   an HTTP Response with the status_assertion_responses JSON member:

HTTP/1.1 200 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "status_assertion_responses": ["${base64url(json({typ: status-assertion+jwt, ...}))}.payload.signature", ... ]
}

   The member status_assertion_responses MUST be an array of strings,
   where each of them represent a Status Assertion Response object, as
   defined in the section Status Assertion (Section 10) or a Status
   Assertion Error object, as defined in the section Status Error
   (Section 9).

   For each entry in the status_assertion_responses array, the following
   requirements are met: - Each element in the array MUST match the
   corresponding element in the request array at the same position index
   to which it is related, eg: _[requestAboutA, requestAboutB]_ produces
   _[responseAboutA, responseErrorAboutB]_. - Each element MUST contain
   the error or the status of the assertion using the typ member. set to
   "status-assertion+{jwt,cwt}" or "status-assertion-error+{jwt,cwt}",
   depending by the object type. - The corresponding entry in the
   response MUST be of the same data format as requested.  For example,
   if the entry in the request is "jwt", then the entry at the same
   position in the response MUST also be "jwt".

9.  Status Assertion Error

   If the Status Assertion is requested for a non-existent, expired,
   revoked or invalid Digital Credential, the Credential Issuer MUST
   respond with an HTTP Response with the status code set to 200 and the
   status_assertion_responses array with the related Status Assertion
   Error object.

   The Status Assertion Error object must contain the parameters
   described in the table below:

   specifically related to the status assertions.

10.  Status Assertion

   When a Status Assertion is requested to a Credential Issuer, the
   Issuer checks the status of the Digital Credential and creates a
   Status Assertion bound to it.

   If the Digital Credential is valid, the Credential Issuer creates a
   new Status Assertion, which a non-normative example is given below
   where the format is JWT.

   {
       "alg": "ES256",
       "typ": "status-assertion+jwt",

11.  Interoperability of Credential Issuers Supporting Status Assertions

   This section outlines how Credential Issuers support Status
   Assertions, detailing the necessary metadata and practices to
   integrate into their systems.

11.1.  Credential Issuer Metadata

   The Credential Issuers that uses the Status Assertions MUST include
   in their OpenID4VCI [@!OpenID.VCI] metadata the claims:

   *  status_assertion_endpoint.  REQUIRED.  It MUST be an HTTPs URL
      indicating the endpoint where the Wallet Instances can request
      Status Assertions.

   *  credential_hash_alg_supported.  REQUIRED.  The supported Algorithm
      used by the Wallet Instance to hash the Digital Credential for
      which the Status Assertion is requested, using one of the hash
      algorithms listed in the [IANA - Named Information Hash Algorithm
      Registry] (https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/
      named-information.xhtml#hash-alg).

11.2.  Issued Digital Credentials

   The Credential Issuers that uses the Status Assertions SHOULD include
   in the issued Digital Credentials the object status with the JSON
   member status_assertion set to a JSON Object containing the following
   member:

   *  credential_hash_alg.  REQUIRED.  The Algorithm used of hashing the
      Digital Credential to which the Status Assertion is bound, using
      one of the hash algorithms listed in the [IANA - Named Information
      Hash Algorithm Registry] (https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-
      information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg).  Among the hash
      algorithms, sha-256 is recommended and SHOULD be implemented by
      all systems.

   The non-normative example of an unsecured payload of an SD-JWT VC is
   shown below.

   {
    "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential",
    "given_name": "John",
    "family_name": "Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
    "address": {
      "street_address": "123 Main St",
      "locality": "Anytown",
      "region": "Anystate",
      "country": "US"
    },
    "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
    "is_over_18": true,
    "is_over_21": true,
    "is_over_65": true,
    "status": {
       "status_assertion": {
           "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
       }
    }
   }

11.2.1.  Credential Issuer Implementation Considerations

   When the Digital Credential is issued, the Credential Issuer SHOULD
   calculate the hash value using the algorithm specified in
   status.status_assertion.credential_hash_alg and store this
   information in its database.  This practice enhances efficiency by
   allowing the Credential Issuer to quickly compare the requested
   credential_hash with the pre-calculated one, when processing Status
   Assertion requests made by Holders.

12.  Presenting Status Assertions

   The Wallet Instance that provides the Status Assertions using
   [@OpenID4VP], SHOULD include in the vp_token JSON array, as defined
   in [@OpenID4VP], the Status Assertion along with the related Digital
   Credential.

   The Verifier that receives a Digital Credential supporting the Status
   Assertion, SHOULD:

   *  Decode and validate the Digital Credential;

   *  Check the presence of status.status_assertion in the Digital
      Credential.  If true, the Verifier SHOULD:

      -  produce the hash of the Digital Credential using the hashing
         algorithm configured in
         status.status_assertion.credential_hash_alg;

      -  decode all the Status Assertions provided in the presentation,
         by matching the JWS Header parameter typ set to status-
         assertion+jwt and looking for the credential_hash value that
         matches with the hash produced at the previous point;

      -  evaluate the validity of the Status Assertion.

13.  Considerations On Revocation Verification

   The recommendation for Verifiers to check the revocation status of
   Digital Credentials as a 'SHOULD' instead of a 'MUST' acknowledges
   that the decision to verify revocation is not absolute and may be
   influenced by various factors.  Consider as an example the case of
   age-over x; even if it has expired, it may still perform its intended
   purpose.  As a result, the expiration status alone does not render it
   invalid.  The adaptability recognizes that the need to verify
   revocation status may not always coincide with the actual usability
   of a Digital Credential, allowing Verifiers to examine and make
   educated conclusions based on a variety of scenarios.

14.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

15.  Privacy Considerations

   In the design and implementation of Status Assertions, particular
   attention has been paid to privacy considerations to ensure that the
   system is respectful of user privacy and compliant with relevant
   regulations.

15.1.  Privacy Consideration: Status Assertion Request Opacity

   The request for a Status Assertion does not transmit the Digital
   Credential for which the status is being attested.  Instead, it
   includes a proof of possession (PoP) of the credential that is only
   interpretable by the Credential Issuer who issued the digital
   credential for which the Status Assertion is requested.  This PoP can
   be achieved through a cryptographic signature using the public key
   contained within the Digital Credential over the request.  This
   method is essential for preventing the potential for fraudulent
   requests intended to mislead or disclose sensitive information to
   unintended parties.  By separating the Digital Credential from the
   status assertion request, the system ensures that the request does
   not inadvertently disclose any information about the Digital
   Credential or its holder.  This strategy significantly enhances the
   privacy and security of the system by preventing the assertion
   process from being used to collect information about Digital
   Credentials or their holders through deceptive requests.

15.2.  Privacy Consideration: Opacity of Status Assertion Content

   An important privacy consideration is how the Status Assertion is
   structured to ensure it does not reveal any information about the
   User or the Holder of the Digital Credential.  The Status Assertion
   is crafted to prove only the vital information needed to verify the
   current state of a Digital Credential, moving beyond simple
   revocation or suspension checks.  This is done by focusing the
   assertion content on the Digital Credential's present condition and
   the method for its verification, rather than on the identity of the
   Digital Credential's Holder.  This approach is key in keeping the
   User's anonymity intact, making sure that the Status Assertion can be
   applied in various verification situations without risking the
   privacy of the people involved.

15.3.  Unlinkability and Reusability of Status Assertions

   Status Assertions are designed to uphold privacy by allowing
   Verifiers to operate independently, without the need for interaction
   or information disclosure to third-party entities or other verifiers.
   This design is pivotal in ensuring unlinkability between Verifiers,
   where actions taken by one Verifier cannot be correlated or linked to
   actions taken by another.  Verifiers can directly validate the status
   of a Digital Credential through the Status Assertion, eliminating the
   need for external communication.  This mechanism is key in protecting
   the privacy of individuals whose Digital Credentials are being
   verified, as it significantly reduces the risk of tracking or
   profiling based on verification activities across various services.

   While Status Assertions facilitate unlinkability, they are not
   inherently "single use."  The specification accommodates the batch
   issuance of multiple Status Assertions, which can be single-use.
   However, particularly for offline interactions, a Single Assertion
   may be utilized by numerous Verifiers.  This flexibility ensures that
   Status Assertions can support a wide range of verification scenarios,
   from one-time validations to repeated checks by different entities,
   without compromising the privacy or security of the Digital
   Credential Holder.

15.4.  Untrackability by Digital Credential Issuers and the "Phone Home"
       Problem

   A fundamental aspect of the privacy-preserving attributes of Status
   Assertions is their ability to address the "phone home" problem,
   which is the prevention of tracking by Digital Credential Issuers.
   Traditional models often require verifiers to query a central status
   list or contact the issuer directly, a process that can inadvertently
   allow Credential Issuers to track when and where a Digital Credential
   is verified.  Status Assertions, however, encapsulate all necessary
   verification information within the assertion itself.  This design
   choice ensures that Credential Issuers are unable to monitor the
   verification activities of their issued Digital Credentials, thereby
   significantly enhancing the privacy of the Holder.  By removing the
   need for real-time communication with the issuer for status checks,
   Status Assertions effectively prevent the issuer from tracking
   verification activities, further reinforcing the system's dedication
   to protecting user privacy.

15.5.  Minimization of Data Exposure

   The Status Assertions are designed around the data minimization
   principle.  Data minimization ensures that only the necessary
   information required for the scope of attesting the non revocation
   status of the Digital Credential.  This minimizes the exposure of
   potentially sensitive data.

15.6.  Resistance to Enumeration Attacks

   The design of Status Assertions incorporates measures to resist
   enumeration attacks, where an adversary attempts to gather
   information by systematically verifying different combinations of
   data.  By implementing robust cryptographic techniques and limiting
   the information contained in Status Assertions, the system reduces
   the feasibility of such attacks.  This consideration is vital for
   safeguarding the privacy of the credential holders and for ensuring
   the integrity of the verification process.

   Status Assertions are based on a privacy-by-design approach,
   reflecting a deliberate effort to balance security and privacy needs
   in the Digital Credential ecosystem.
